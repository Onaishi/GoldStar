Environmentally focused platform with a market for good deeds.
(Abstract/Intent) Improving the environments that we interact with every day refocuses energy in an intentional way. when energy is redirected with proper intentionality, the benefits can be far reaching and long lasting. Limiting negativity and planning for future occurrencesâ€™, whilst constantly attending to   remediation of consequences from past will help the most people the most often.
[Description] Collaborative Team/market Backed by the Ethereum Based  Cryptocurrency "GoldStar" (GST). CMs (Community Members) Take on Seller and Buyer roles, And EMs act as Moderators. to create a community based on trading real-world value. [Only experienced CM may apply to occasionally take-on EM roles.]
CM [Seller] Post Projects (of any Scope or Scale) consisting of photo and video evidence of perceived environmental discrepancies, which must progress in Prestige. (Projects must include a greater than 15sec video AND 3 different photos from different angles and distances [as to add maximum clarity for Buyers]).
as Projects progress in Prestige, they can acquire TRP (Total Remediation Prestige). [Projects with TRP can be sold for GST].
Projects must include: a summary of the overall scope, an assessment of required PPE, a total "PEH" evaluation (Perceived Environmental Harm) [total PEH = estimated SH (Static Harm) or the current level of environmental impact] x Estimated "VH" (Variable Harm)[the level of environmental impact as time progresses], estimated cost to acquire TRP, an ideal timeline to complete the Project.
CM [Buyers] anonymously review proposed Projects and offer "CC" (Constructive Criticism). If a buyer does not offer CC, they will have Bought the project. [All CC must be approved by a group of elected EMs] EMs approve and release anonymized CC to CMs. When a Project is Bought by a scalable number of CMs the Project will acquire RRP (Recommending Remediation Prestige).
If the Project acquires RRP, the CM [Seller] may: complete the Project and apply for TRP or Request "ARP" (Assisted Remediation Prestige) 
When TRP is acquired the CM may sell the Project for GST.
Initially Projects will be OSFA (One Size Fits All). A Project's Scale will be determined by calculating the DCTAR (Desired Compensation to Achieve Remediation) for each project
Project Scales will ultimately be Tangent to the DCTAR. (for Example) Small projects = Projects w/ DCTAR <1.0 GST w/o need for ARP. Large projects = Projects w/ DCTAR >1.0 GST (regardless of ARP)
Ultimately the primary vector for Project completion will be thru MPs (Micro Projects). [MPs will have PSTs (Pre-Set Tasks) w/ defined DCTARS Reducing the number of required Buyers and minimizing need for CC].
Initially Projects will require a Secondary Sale to Progress from RRP to TRP. 
To apply for TRP, a Project must, already have acquired TRP in a Primary Sale.
The secondary sale will be conducted with EMs as Buyers.
When enough EMs have Bought the Project a scalable number of times, the Project will acquire TRP.
after acquiring TRP a Project can then be traded for GST.
